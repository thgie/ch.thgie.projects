# Eat Your Sidewalk Codebook - Translation
May 01, 2018 - May 01, 2019 

My wonderful friend [Daniel](https://drognitz.ch) and I translated the [Eat Your Sidewalk Codebook](https://eatyoursidewalk.org/products/the-codebook) into German. We  collaborated with the wonderful folks of [Spurse](http://www.spurse.org/) on this.
